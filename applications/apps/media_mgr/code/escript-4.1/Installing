When you install Erlang, escript might be included.

To test if escript is installed give the following
command in this directory

	$ ./factorial 10

If this succeeds then escript is installed.

If escript is not installed then give the following
command

	$ make

This creates a script called escript.

You can test this in the current working directory.

	$ ./factorial 12
	factorial 12 = 479001600
	$ ./hello
	Hello world

Now you can either add escript to your PATH or move
escript to some directory in your PATH. I usually move

escript to my ~/bin directory which is in my PATH.
