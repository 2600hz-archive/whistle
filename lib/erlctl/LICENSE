The erlctl library itself is licensed publicly under the Lesser GNU Public
License, v3. See LGPL-3.txt for details. It is our intent that you may use
erlctl in any program you see fit, so long as changes to erlctl itself are
released under the same license.

While not required by our license terms, Scatterbit would very much appreciate
if the copyright for any changes was assigned to Scatterbit, Inc. This will
allow us to integrate your changes into the mainline distribution, thereby
improving everyone's experience, increasing the testing of your code by the
community, and reduce the maintenance load on your programmers by reducing the
work they must do to stay current.

The ctl_ex application (everything under lib/ctl_ex-*) is released under the
CC0 license. This is similar to being Public Domain, but shields us from
liability for how you use the code. Essentially, it's yours--and if it breaks,
you get to keep both pieces. See CC0.txt for details.

This is intended to allow you and yours to develop applications using the CLI
component of our examples as a base. Hopefully, this should alleviate any
fears that we're going to release the hounds (errr, lawyers) because you
"stole" our example code for your application.

We also recommend that you have a lot of fun, and do cool stuff. We figure
that anyone who reads to the end of the license file probably has the drive
(or at least the OCD) necessary to do great things. :)
