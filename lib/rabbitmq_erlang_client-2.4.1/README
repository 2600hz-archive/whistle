AMQP client for Erlang
======================
This code implements a client for AMQP in the Erlang programming
language.

This client offers both a networked version that uses standard
TCP-based AMQP framing and a direct client that uses native Erlang
message passing to a RabbitMQ broker.

The API exposed to the user is common to both clients, so each version
can be used interchangeably without having to modify any client code.

The TCP networked client has been tested with RabbitMQ server 1.4.0,
but should theoretically work with any 0-8 compliant AMQP server.

The direct client is bound to an 0-8 compliant broker using native
Erlang message passing, which in the absence of an alternative Erlang
AMQP implementation means that it only works with RabbitMQ.

It does however provide a level of abstraction above the internal
server API of RabbitMQ, meaning that you can write client code in
Erlang and still remain isolated from any API changes in the
underlying broker.

It also provides a client-orientated API into RabbitMQ, allowing the
user to reuse AMQP knowledge gained by using AMQP clients in other
languages.

The advantage of the direct client is that it eliminates the network
overhead as well as the marshaling to and from the AMQP wire format,
so that neither side has to decode or encode any AMQP frames.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to compile/run this code you must have the following
installed:

- Erlang/OTP, R11B-5 or later, http://www.erlang.org/download.html
- The RabbitMQ server, 93cc2ca0ba62 or later
- Eunit, the Erlang unit testing framework - currently the whole build process
  depends on eunit because all of the modules are compiled together.
  A future version of the build process could remove this dependency when you
  only want to compile the core libraries.

Getting Eunit
-------------
The test suite uses eunit which is either available bundled with OTP from
release R12B-5 onwards or as a separate download that you will need to build
yourself if you are using an older version of Erlang.

* If you are using R12B-5 or newer:

Just skip to the next section.

* If you are using R12B-4 or older:

Check out eunit from their Subversion repository and build it:

    $ svn co http://svn.process-one.net/contribs/trunk/eunit eunit
    $ cd eunit
    $ make

After this has sucessfully been built, you will need to create a symlink to
the eunit directory in your OTP installation directory:

    $ cd $OTP_HOME/lib/erlang/lib
    $ ln -sf PATH_TO_EUNIT eunit

where $OTP_HOME is the location of your Erlang/OTP installation.

Compiling the Erlang client
-------------------------
You will need to get a copy of the server in order to be able to use it's
header files and runtime libraries. A good place to put this is in the sibling
directory to the Erlang client (i.e: ../rabbitmq-server), which is the default
that the Makefile expects. In this case, you can just run make:

    $ make

If the source tree for the server is not in the sibling directory, you will
need to specify the path to this directory:

    $ make BROKER_DIR=/path/to/server

In this case, make sure you specify BROKER_DIR every time you run a make target.

Running the network client, direct client and packaging tests
-------------------------------------------------------------
The direct client has to be run in the same Erlang VM instance as the
RabbitMQ server. In order to use the makefile to run tests, you will need to
shutdown any other running instance of RabbitMQ server that you may have on
your machine. This is because the Makefile test targets boot their own instance
of RabbitMQ with settings depending on the test.
To run these tests, use either of the following targets:

    $ make test_network
    $ make test_direct
    $ make test_common_package

Or to run all tests:

    $ make all_tests

If any test fails, the make command will return a non-zero exit code. The reason
is logged by the server in /tmp/rabbit-sasl.log by default.

The network client test can also be run from a separate Erlang VM instance from
RabbitMQ server. You can *start an instance of the server* and then, in the
rabbitmq-erlang-client folder, type

    rabbitmq-erlang-client $ make compile_tests
    rabbitmq-erlang-client $ make run
    erl -pa ebin ../rabbitmq-server/ebin tests
    Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.5 [source] [64-bit] [smp:4] \
    [async-threads:0] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

    Eshell V5.6.5  (abort with ^G)
    1> network_client_SUITE:test().

To get more examples of the API, look at the functions in the test_util module.

Make targets
------------
Interesting rabbitmq-erlang-client make targets include

all
    The default target. Builds the client (does not compile the tests).

compile
    Builds the client.

compile_tests
    Builds the client test modules.

run
    Builds the client and starts an Erlang shell with both the client and the
    server in the load path.

run_in_broker
    Builds the client and starts RabbitMQ server with shell and the client
    included in load path.

clean
    Removes build products and wipes all files produced by any other
    rabbitmq-erlang-client make targets or client errors.

dialyze
    Analyses the client source code with dialyzer. Uses PLT file from default
    location: ~/.dialyzer_plt. Use

        $ make PLT=/path/to/plt dialyze

    to override this. Add broker to PLT beforehand, otherwise you will a lot
    of 'unknown function' warnings. See add_broker_to_plt make target.

dialyze_all
    Same as dialyze, except that this also analyses tests source code.

add_broker_to_plt
    Adds broker .beam files to default plt. Use

        $ make PLT=/path/to/plt add_broker_to_plt

    to override default plt location ( ~/.dialyzer_plt ).

source_tarball
    Creates tarball of all the client source code.

package
    Creates an erlang archive of the client.

common_package
    Creates an erlang archive of the server modules required by the erlang
    client.

all_tests
    Clean compiles the client and client tests source code and runs
    network_client_SUITE, direct_client_SUITE and packaging tests. During the
    testing, this make target runs an instance of the broker, so make sure
    there is no other instance of RabbitMQ server running.
