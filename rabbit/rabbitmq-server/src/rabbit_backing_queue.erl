     %% allows the backing queue to perform any checking necessary for
     %% the consistency of those queues, or initialise any other
     %% shared resources.

     %% Called to tear down any state/resources. NB: Implementations
     %% should not depend on this function being called on shutdown
     %% and instead should hook into the rabbit supervision hierarchy.

     %% Initialise the backing queue and its state.
